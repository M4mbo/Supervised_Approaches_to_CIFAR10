# Supervised_Approaches_to_CIFAR10
Supervised machine learning is a widely used form of artificial intelligence. There are plenty of ways to approach supervised learning: Some of them being Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks and Residual Networks. In this repository we develop an in depth analysis of the difference between these on the CIFAR10 dataset using Jupyter Notebooks and Pytorch.
